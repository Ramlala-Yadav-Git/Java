     * INHERITANCE :-

     * It is the mechanism in jave by which one class is allowed to inheritr

     * 
     * 3. Hierarchical Inheritence :- One prent has many childs
     * 
     * 4. Multiple Inheritence :- One child multiple parents, java does not support,
     * but by interface we can use
     * 
     * 5. Hybrid :- mixture
     * 
     * 
     * 6. Cyclic inheritence : java does not support, class inherits itself
